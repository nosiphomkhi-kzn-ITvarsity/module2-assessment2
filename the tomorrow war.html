                     <P>Title: The Tomorrow War</P>
                     <p>Actors: Chris Pratt, Yvonne</p>

                     <P>The Tomorrow War is a post-apocalyptic film set in the war-torn world of 2051. The film stars Chris Prat as Dan Forester, a biology teacher and former Green Beret who is called upon to fight a war 30 years in the future. Now he has to travel to 2051, along with several civilians, 
                     and fight a war against alien monsters called the Whitespikes.It has been noticed that the film has a similar premise as the 1996 hit film The Independence Day. On Independence Day, a ragtag group of survivors gathers to save the world, in the aftermath of a worldwide attack by an unknown extraterrestrial race.
                     The Tomorrow War had a curious way of paying homage to the 1996 hit film by name-dropping the star of Independence Day, Will Smith.
                     The Tomorrow War pays an ode to The Independence Day, as soon as Dan Forester and his crew of recruits time travel to 2051 and land on a rooftop in Miami. The city has been destroyed in the war with the Whitespikes. As they look upon the destruction, a veteran soldier, Dorian quips, “Welcome to Miami. </P>
                     <p>It is ironic how Will Smith being dead in The Tomorrow War echoes his death in The Independence Day: Resurgence. Will Smith refused to reprise his role in the sequel to The Independence Day. Therefore, his character was written off from the sequel and it was revealed that his character Steven Hiller died sometime in the 30 years between Independence Day and Resurgence. 
                      Smith’s fellow cast members from Independence Day like Jeff Goldblum and Bill Pullman reprised their roles in the sequel.  </p>
