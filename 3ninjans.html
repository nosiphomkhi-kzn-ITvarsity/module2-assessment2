                    <P> suburban California brothers, visit their grandfather Mori Tanaka's cabin in the desert to train to become ninjas. On their last day of summer vacation, the boys receive "ninja names": Samuel is Rocky because of his strength and level headed mentality, Jeffrey is Colt because of his speed and temper like a young wild horse, and Michael is Tum Tum due to his energy coming from his gluttony. They witness a confrontation between their grandfather and Hugo Snyder, ex-student/partner of Tanaka and a criminal who is being pursued by the boys' father, FBI agent Sam Douglas. 
                     Snyder plans to kidnap the boys with the help of his assistant Mr. Brown, who employs his irresponsible nephew Fester and his friends Hammer and Marcus to abduct them.
                     After a failed attempt at kidnapping foiled by the three boys outsmarting the three men while their parents are out, Mr. Brown along with heavyweight fighter "Rushmore" appear and they easily capture the trio, leaving a note with Rocky's girlfriend Emily, telling Sam that Snyder has kidnapped his children in retaliation for his constant attempts to arrest him. Mori arrives at the house, and Sam reluctantly agrees to give him one hour to rescue the children.Rocky, Colt, and Tum Tum are torn between seeing a championship baseball game through to the end or going to Japan to deliver a golden dagger to their grandfather;
                     they choose the latter. On the way to Japan they meet Miyo, a girl who Rocky is very fond of. When Koga gets the dagger and sword, he tries to open the cave of gold. Koga and Mori become friends and Miyo gets the dagger. During their Japanese adventure, the kids learn important skills and life lessons which help them win the final baseball game of their season, with Colt hitting a home run. A poor sport on the opposing team picks on them; he attempts to attack Miyo, but ends up getting knocked unconscious during one of the final scenes. </P>
