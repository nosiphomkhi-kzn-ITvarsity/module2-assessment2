                    <h2>BURGER KING</h2>
                    <P>Burger King creates unique characteristics that differentiate it from its competitors. It supplies this differentiation through its advertising and brand representation. Its slogan, Be Your Way, lets customers know that the chain offers flexible options.
                     The very first BURGER KING® restaurant in South Africa opened its doors in May 2013. A joint venture between Western Cape-based investment company, Grand Parade Investments, and BURGER KING® Worldwide, BURGER KING® South Africa was launched in the Western Cape and continues to expand nationally.
                     BURGER KING® South Africa plans to keep contributing to the South African economy and creating a significant number of jobs for South Africans over the years. 
                     Despite intense competition in the fast-food market, Burger King has created a strong brand position thanks to its clever growth strategies. It is well-known that the franchise’s burgers are good, but in the beginning, Burger King struggled to compete globally with market leader McDonald’s massive advertising budget. 
                     So how did Burger King carve out its place in the burger market. </p>
                     <P>  Burger King creates unique characteristics that differentiate it from its  competitors. It supplies this differentiation through its advertising and brand representation. Its slogan, Be Your Way, lets customers know that the chain offers flexible options. In terms of its product offering, it has a fine way of grilling its burger patties and offering free drink refills.
                     Burger King also employs intensive growth strategies by opening new stores in overseas locations where there are no operations. Its cost leadership strategy is particularly important when it tries to break into emerging markets.
                     Burger King foods include the Original Chicken Sandwich, the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, and spicy chicken nuggets. Plus, Burger King's breakfast menu is filled with tasty deals.
